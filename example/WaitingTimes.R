# The Waiting Time Paradox #
###############

# The Waiting Time Paradox is well known. If a train is supposed to arrive, on average, every 
# 10 minutes, you would expect to be waiting less than 10 minutes for a train. This is
# in fact only true if trains arrive exactly every 10 minutes.

mean(diff(train_times))

# shows that the average time between trains is indeed close to 10 minutes...

# can then simulate people arriving at that particular station and determine how long
# they each have to wait for the next train
